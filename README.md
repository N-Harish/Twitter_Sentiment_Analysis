DESCRIPTION:-
I've used spacy and sklearn to do sentiment analysis of twitter data from kaggle.

Cleaned the data using regex and removed stopwords using spacy stop words.

lemmatized the text and the used TFIdfVectorizer 

Decoded unicodes to actual strings using unicodedata library

Created new feature called no of hashtags counting the number of hashtags in each tweet

added all the above preprocessing steps and created a function out of it
